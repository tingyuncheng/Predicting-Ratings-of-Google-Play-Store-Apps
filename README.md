# Predicting-Ratings-of-Google-Play-Store-Apps

This was a group project for an introduction to Python course. I was originally responsible for literature, data pre-processing, and Decision Tree development. To create this repository, I reviewed this project, imputing the NULL values differently, enriching the visualization, restructuring the whole thing, and writing more thoughts and conclusion on it.
